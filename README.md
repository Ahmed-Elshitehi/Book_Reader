# Book_Reader Application
In this project, I'm just trying to implement some OOP concepts using c++. <br>
<hr>
- Take a look at the UML <hr>
<br>

> - we have three main objects Book, User, and Admin
>> - Admins have the ability to add and remove books from the system <br>
>> - The user can add books from the system to his own library and he can read them. <br>
>> - You can log in and sign up as an admin or user. <br>
>> - It's impossible that two users or admins have the same user_name.
